                  The way the app works is that it refreshes class data every 5 minutes. Unfortunately, if spots open up
                  and a student registers for it in a 5 minute time frame, my service will never know a spot was open.{" "}
                  {"It's"} only once a spot is open for more than 5 minutes that {"it'll"} notify you.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Additionally, the service relies on USCs class API - this is the service that provides the information
                  of class information, and it is not run by me. Sometimes their service is laggy, or {"doesn't"} update
                  perfectly. In these cases I {"don't"} have any control over the information. <br />
                  <br />
                  This is why the service is marked as beta and says that it is not guaranteed to work. For crucial
                  classes, for instance those needed to graduate, I recommend also manually checking it once a day.{" "}
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Also a few notes - if a class {"hasn't"} opened up spots yet, it {"won't"} work, as it {"won't"} know
                  if the spots {"haven't"}
                  been released or if {"they're"} full yet, and will just continuously spam you with emails.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If you {"haven't"} received text messages but have paid for them, and section hasn't been marked as
                  paid in your dashboard within 1 hour, please reach out to usc@jonlu.ca for support. <br />
                  <br />
                  As a reminder, this is just a service I, a student at USC, made in my spare time. {"It's"} not a
                  company, or an
                  {`"official"`} thing - {"it's"} just a CS students side project, so please keep that in mind!

                    No - every $1 is good for unlimited text messages for 1 section of 1 class for that semester. So if{" "}
                    {"you're"}
                    watching CSCI-103 section 123, and you get a text message, you {"don't"} need to pay again to watch
                    CSCI-103 section 123. If you want to watch section 124, you would need to pay another $1.
