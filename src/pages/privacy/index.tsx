          <p>
            You may use this Site without disclosing to us any personally identifiable information. We do not
            automatically collect any personally identifiable information from you (e.g., name, address, telephone

          </p>
          <p>
            Like most websites, however, the Site automatically collects certain non-personally identifiable information

            type of computer/operating system, date/time stamps, user interface interaction data (e.g., mouse clicks or

            pages viewed and or uniform resource locator (URL) information (showing where you came from or where you go
            to next). We use this information to improve the Site’s design, estimate user volume and usage patterns,
            speed up searches, and improve the user experience. We may also use this information to help diagnose
            problems with our server and to administer our website, analyze trends, track visitor movements, and gather
            broad demographic information that assists us in identifying visitor preferences.

            Each time a user visits the Site, we may automatically collect an internet protocol (IP) address and the web
            page from which the user was directed to the Site. In order to administer and optimize the Site and to
            diagnose and resolve potential issues or security threats to our Site or to the Company, we may use an IP
            address to help identify users and to gather broad demographic information about them.

            Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to a user’s device through the web
            browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize the browser and
            capture and remember certain information. We use cookies to optimize Site functionality and improve a user’s
            experience while navigating through the Site. Most or all browsers permit you to disable or reject cookies.

            Our Site may incorporate “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” or similar tracking technologies (collectively, “pixel
            tags”) that track the actions of Site users. Pixel tags are used to collect information, such as the
            internet service provider, IP address, the type of browser software and operating system being used, the
            date and time the Site is accessed, the website address, if any, from which a user linked directly to the
            Site and/or the website address, if any, to which the user travels from the Site and other similar

            Examples of anonymous information may include certain information about the internet browser, domain type,
            service provider and IP address information collected through tracking technologies and aggregated or
            de-identified data. We use anonymous analytics information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the
            features and functionality of the Site, improve our services, analyze trends and administer our web
            applications.
